# Static HTML Website with CSS Assignment

This assignment is worth 25% of the web development module on a HDip in Software Development course.

In this assignment you are required to design and develop a 5 page static HTML website that utilizes one or more external CSS files and a Grid system of your own creation.[^1] The key deliverables for this project are:

1. Pencil Project wire frame Design of Grid system
2. Pencil Project wire frame Design for all pages
3. Five Page Website, styled with external CSS file(s)
4. W3C Validated HTML and CSS
5. A detailed Report on the design process and how the site fulfills the design objective described below.

## Background

You are required to develop a website to promote manual focus, wet process photography; specifically Nikon or Canon manual focus cameras from the 1960â€™s to present day. Traditional film cameras went into major decline upon the development of digital photography. However, there remains a dedicated following for traditional wet process photography.

## Key Design Objective

The site should be targeted at people under 35 years looking for something different or more traditional. Your objective is to educate and sell film cameras to them. Your core message should be that image creation takes time, and old cameras will teach you how. You should also present site visitors with useful resource links for film, chemical and paper. Use images, audio and video to reinforce your message where necessary.

## Site Content & Structure

- Text - At least one sentence to describe what the article or paragraph will contain. Remaining sentences may be filled out with Lorem Ipsum, but use a variety of extracts from Lorem.
- Images - Each image used must be listed in your report, along with the licensing and source information.
- Video & Audio - All video & audio must be licensed under creative commons or similar open licensing system. Each video and audio clip used must be listed in your report, along with the licensing and source information.
- Your website is to have a logical folder structure, with separate folders for images, audio, video, wire frame diagrams, and css files.

## Report

Your report should be laid out in a professional manner, as would be done for a client. This involves, *inter-alia*, a cover page, table of contents, and logical sectioning. Your report should include wire frame images, website screen shots, and other details necessary to communicate design intent.

## Submission

Your completed website and documentation are to be zipped into a single file[^2] and uploaded on or before the date and time indicated. You will be asked to demonstrate the site and explain its operation to your lecturer during class time following submission.
